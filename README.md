## Learning to Localize in Unseen Scenes with Relative Pose Regressors
Official PyTorch implementation of Learning to Localize in Unseen Scenes with Relative Pose Regressors, for details see our paper [Learning to Localize in Unseen Scenes with Relative Pose Regressors]

The figure below illustrates our approach: a query image and reference image are put to our architecture, we then extract informative features using a convolutional backbone, 
concatenate the query and reference images features and use two relformers blocks separately attend to position-  and orientation- .
